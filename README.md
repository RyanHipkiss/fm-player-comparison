# FM Player Comparison

## Overview

A tool to compare players in a given data set, and determine the best signings to make for each position - based on the designated tactic.

## Why

There is a lot of data provided by Football Manager, some much more complex than others. The idea of this tool was to determine in a "moneyball approach", which players would have the biggest impact in my team. Which players fit my model, and cost.
